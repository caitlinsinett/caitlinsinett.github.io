            <h2>Caitlin Sinett's Website</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal website! This is a website containing my portfolio, resume, contact information and what you should know about me. It shows articles I have written, photos I have taken, videos I am in, where I have worked, who I am and how to get in touch with me if you need more information. I made this website to show who I am as a journalist. Enjoy!</p>
               
                <h3>My website:</h3>
            
                <p class="end">This website shows what I have done so far as a journalist and my experiences in different areas of the field. I want this to be like an online museum for people to be able to come and see who I am and what I have done. I created this website from scratch through Brackets and Github. I wrote both the HTML and CSS.</p>
