            <h2>About Me, Caitlin Sinett</h2>
            <p>I am a journalism major at the University of Florida (Go Gators!) in Gainesville, Fla., who is interested in print and broadcast journalism. I especially enjoy reporting on features, politics and health. Reporting is my passion, and my goal is to become a reporter for a news outlet either in broadcast or print. I have previous experience in both. I also have experience in producing online news videos and reading and producing for radio. For more information, you can check out my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.
            </p>
    <p>This summer I will be interning in Washington, D.C., with The Washington Center program, and I am excited to explore the area where the journalism world is centered. I will be interning for <a href="http://www.doublerproductions.com"target="_blank" title="Double R Productions">Double R Productions</a>, which is a full service, woman-owned communications firm specializing in video, television and all manners of media/web production. I hope to gain a lot of experience from the program and get comfortable and familiarized with the D.C. area. I want to know more about journalism, and I want this summer to be a giant stepping stone for my career.</p>
