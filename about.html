            <h2>About Me, Caitlin Sinett</h2>
            <p>I am a journalism major at the University of Florida (Go Gators!) in Gainesville, Fla., who is interested in print and broadcast journalism. I especially enjoy reporting on feature stories, politics and health. Reporting is my passion, and my goal is to become a reporter for a news outlet either in broadcast or print. I have previous experience in both. I also have experience in producing online news videos and reading and producing for radio. For more information, you can check out my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>, <a href="multimedia.html">multimedia</a> and <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> pages.
            </p>
    <p>This summer I interned in Washington, D.C., with The Washington Center program, and I met many journalists who are very established, such as Jamie McIntyre from National Public Radio, Juliet Eilperin from The Washington Post and Jackie Bensen from NBC4. I interned for <a href="http://www.doublerproductions.com" target="_blank" title="Double R Productions">Double R Productions</a>, which is a full service, woman-owned communications firm specializing in video, television and all manners of media/web production. I have gained a lot of hands-on experience from the program and am comfortable and familiarized with the D.C. area. I have learned how to shoot video, edit video in Avid Media Composer, make video blogs, add captions through MacCaptions to video and be a reporter in front of a camera. My goal this summer was to learn more about broadcast journalism, and I have reached that goal. This summer has been a giant stepping stone for my career. In the fall I will be interning for WCJB TV-20 in Gainesville.</p>
