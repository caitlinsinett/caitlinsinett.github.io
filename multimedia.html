        <p>This video blog was created by the intern team at Double R Productions, which included me, Robert Woods and Anthony Lestochi. We came up with the concept, wrote a script, shot the video and edited it in Avid Media Composer as a team.</p>

        <p>On our second day the Double R Productions intern team was sent out to shoot a protest on Washington, D.C., gym taxes in front of the John A. Wilson building. I interviewed the protestors and edited the video.</p>

        <p>The Double R intern team went to The Capitol to make a news video of a press conference covering the Social Security and Marriage Equality Act. This was the first time I interviewed a representative, Elizabeth Esty. For this video, I interviewed advocates for the SAME Act, and I edited the video as well.</p>

        <p>I made this video for my Multimedia Reporting class. The assignment was to shoot a video interview and B-roll for a journalistic story. I decided to do a profile on Robert Scheppske:</p>

        <p>I made this <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/125330931/sinettc_soundslides4/index.html" target="_blank" title="Students Party">slideshow</a> through Soundslides for my Multimedia Reporting class. I took the photos, created my own MP3 file and made captions for all my photos. This slideshow is about the Students Party at the University of Florida and what it's goals are.</p>

        <p>This <a href="http://www.wuft.org/news/2013/08/29/lifesouth/" target="_blank" title="LifeSouth">article</a> is about people who received a tattoo after Jan. 1, 2013, are eligible to donate blood at LifeSouth Community Blood Centers. I created a video about LifeSouth, what they do and the costs they incur. </p>
