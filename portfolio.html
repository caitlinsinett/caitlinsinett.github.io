        <p>I wrote this article while working for The Gainesville Sun in the summer of 2013. It's about how LifeSouth Community Blood Center's license was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to manufacture cord blood. That blood is a good source for stem cells and bone marrow. This article was picked up by the Associated Press. Here's the link. </p>

Here's the link.  </p>
