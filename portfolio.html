         <h3>FDA gives rare certification to LifeSouth cord blood program </h3>
        <p>I wrote this article while working for The Gainesville Sun in the summer of 2013. It's about how LifeSouth Community Blood Center's license was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to manufacture cord blood. That blood is a good source for stem cells and bone marrow. This article was picked up by the Associated Press. Here's the <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20130614/ARTICLES/130619772/0/search" target="_blank" title="LifeSouth">link</a>.</p>
       <h3>Romance blooms on a short, crowded flight to Atlanta</h3>
        <p>This article is about how Christopher and Andre Ferraro met on a Delta Air Lines flight to Atlanta. They sat next to each other, and long story short: They fell in love. The couple lives in Gainesville now. This story was the first article I wrote for The Sun. Here's the <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20130521/ARTICLES/130529927/0/search" target="_blank" title="Romance">link</a>. </p>
        <h3>Miss Florida once again hails from Gator Nation</h3>
        <p>Myrrhanda Jones was named Miss Florida 2013 by the Miss America Organization, winning $21,300 in scholarship money. I got to interview Jones, who attends the University of Florida, and learned how she got to this point. I was given less than 10 hours to write this story, and I finished it before the deadline. Here's the <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20130715/ARTICLES/130719771/0/search" target="_blank" title="Miss Florida">link.</a>  </p>
        
       <h3>Completing the 2,854 miles of the Tour Divide, a grueling father-son adventure</h3>
        <p>After a long journey through the United States, I interviewed Peter Kraft Sr., a Gainesville resident who had completed a 2,854-mile  bike race with his son. This article was very interesting to me because I met Kraft Sr. in person, and I could see how this journey had affected him physically. This article was also tricky because there were so many numbers to remember, and I wanted to make sure I got every detail right. The journey this father and son had was absolutely incredible.

        <h3>Late-blooming lawyer now holds prestigious Bar position</h3>
        <p>Eugene K. Pettis is a University of Florida graduate who became the first black president of The Florida Bar in 2013. Pettis discussed his family life while growing up, and he talked to me about his journey up to becoming The Bar's president. I enjoyed this feature story because it was fascinating to me how this man had gone from wanting to be a dentist to being the 65th president of The Florida Bar. Here's the <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20130805/ARTICLES/130809791/0/search" target="_blank" title="Pettis">link</a>. </p>
        
      <h3>Feds now back morning-after pills for all girls</h3>
        <p>This Gainesville Sun article was about how a U.S. district judge ruled that girls of any age would be able to buy emergency contraception without a prescription. In Gainesville, a Publix pharmacist said the morning-after pill was not purchased very often, but when I talked to a Walgreens pharmacist, she said the exact opposite. She said the pill was purchased almost two or three times a day. The story was a challenge because not many pharmacists from stores wanted to talk to me, so I had to call many different stores and speak to managers in order to get to the pharmacists that would talk to me. I also had less than 10 hours to write this article for The Gainesville Sun. Here's the <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20130611/WIRE/130619919/0/search" target="_blank" title="Morning After Pills">link</a>.</p>
     <h3>Twinkies returning to local supermarket shelves</h3>
    
        <p>Twinkies made a comeback in July 2013. This Gainesville Sun article was so much fun to write because I got to be creative and researched the Hostess snack for the story. Here's the <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20130714/ARTICLES/130719796/0/search" target="_blank" title="Twinkies">link</a>.</p>

         <h3>Florida National Lyme Disease Symptoms Misdiagnosed At Alarming Rate</h3>
        <p>I wrote this article for WUFT News, and it was about people who had been bitten by ticks and did not know it. These people had Lyme disease and had symptoms ranging from brain fog to joint pain. I spoke with University of Florida's Dr. Holly Donohoe who told me the number of people who reported having Lyme disease in the U.S. has increased over the past decade. She explained that the main problem is physicians don't know how to diagnose the disease. This story was extremely interesting to me, and I was curious to know how Lyme disease had affected these people. Here's the <a href="http://www.wuft.org/news/2013/09/19/horrifying-lyme-disease-symptoms-misdiagnosed-at-alarming-rate/" target="_blank" title="Lyme disease">link</a>.</p>

     <h3 class="clear">WUFT News in 90</h3>
        <p class="clear">WUFT News in 90 is a 90-second video clip of the news. I alternated between producer and anchor every week. I learned how to create the video in Adobe Premiere Pro and record the video while my colleague was an anchor. I also learned how to get in front of the camera and read from a teleprompter. My first News in 90 clip was Sept. 16, 2013. Click <a href="http://www.wuft.org/news/2013/09/16/sept-16-2013-afternoon-news-in-90/" target="_blank" title="News in 90">here</a> to go to it.</p>

    <h3>Liberation through Dogged Determination</h3>
        <p> This was the first story I've ever written, and the first story that I got published. Todd Bowen showed me how to walk with a guide dog and approach people who own a guide dog. The news story explains the process the guide dog and the blind person go through before they are paired together. The story was published in The Fine Print. Here's the <a href="http://www.thefineprintuf.org/2012/04/26/guide-dogs-gainesville-fl/" target="_blank" title="Guide Dog Story">link</a>.</p>

    <h3> WUFT-FM Radio Reading Service Picture</h3>  
    <p>This picture was taken with an Olympus FE-370 8.0 megapixel digital camera. The picture was taken in the WUFT - FM Radio Reading Service room while Nelly Stavro was reading for Newsprint Today. Stavro produced the show and operated the switchboard.
